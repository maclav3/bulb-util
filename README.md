##### A cli util to control TP-Link smart bulbs with cool features

This is a fun pastime project, which aims to both give the author something creative to do for a few evenings
and provide some features that the Kasa app is missing and the author deems necessary. 

Planned features:
1. A more realistic circadian rhythm simulation, with configurable latitude/longitude and
semi-realistic color/brightness simulation - more reminiscent of real sunlight than the Kasa circadian mode
1. A music visualization mode
1. Steering of color/brightness with a joystick, e.g. an xbox controller - just for fun

Ideas for features are welcome.
